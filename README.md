# CoinFlipDecision

## Project temporarily on hold
This project will temporarily be on hold as I'm shifting my focus back onto my string art robot project to hopefully register for ISEF. I do plan on finishing this project, however due to registration being due around mid January, and needing a decent amount of work I need to focus on that.

## Why
Well, I hope this is pretty specific to me, however if there's ever a decision I have to make which both options have very similar benefits / consequences and I cannot decide  which option to do, I flip a coin. I think it would be funny to be able to do this and have a log of which choices got picked, and whether I regret said decision.
